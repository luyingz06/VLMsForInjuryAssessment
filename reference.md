## 1. Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context

Highly compute-efficient multimodal models capable of recalling and reasoning from at least 10M tokens of context. 

The Gemini family: Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash (lightweight variant). Gemini 1.5 Pro maintains high levels of performance even as its contextwindow increases. Gemini 1.5 Pro relative to 1.5 Pro (Feb), achieves a win-rate of 92.3% in vision and Gemini 1.5 Flash achieves a win-rate of 90.5% relative to 1.0 Pro. Gemini 1.5 Flash while beingsmaller and way more efficient and faster to serve, maintains high levels of performance even as its context window increases.

 Both Gemini 1.5 Pro andGemini 1.5 Flash greatly surpass Gemini 1.0 Pro.

 In addition to serving 2M+ context, Gemini 1.5 models were designed for high efficiency and lowlatency at all context lengths.

 Flash 8B: While Flash-8Bâ€™s smaller form factor necessarily leads to a reduction in quality compared to Flashand 1.5 Pro, it unlocks substantial benefits, particularly in terms of high throughput and extremelylow latency. High throughput and extremely low latency.

## 6. (LLaVA OneVision) LLaVA-OneVision: Easy Visual Task Transfer

large vision-and-language assistant (LLaVA).

Chart, Diagram, and Document Understanding. As the main visual formats for structured OCRdata, we evaluate the results on AI2D [54], ChartQA [101], DocVQA [103], and InfoVQA [102]benchmarks. Though current open-source models such as InternVL [22] and Cambrian [133] achieveperformance comparable to commercial models, LLaVA-OneVision goes a step further, surpassingGPT-4V [109] and approaching the performance level of GPT-4o [110]. 

In single-image understanding, GPT-4o , Gemini-1.5-Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet show the best performances on those benchmarks. LLaVA-OV-7B has less satisfying performance than GPT-4o but surpasses Qwen-VL-MAX.

Llava OV compared to Llava: optimized for better fusion of vision and language tasks, offering improved integration for image-text scenarios.
