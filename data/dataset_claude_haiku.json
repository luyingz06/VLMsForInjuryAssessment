                "trauma_torso": "The image shows a fenced-off area with overgrown vegetation and several large objects, possibly debris or construction materials, scattered on the ground. There is a building or structure visible in the background beyond the fencing. No visible human figures or torso injuries are present in this image.",
                "trauma_lower_ext": "The image shows a fenced-in outdoor area with various objects and debris scattered around. There appears to be some kind of structure or building visible in the background beyond the fencing. However, I do not see any person or evidence of a person with lower extremity injuries in this image.",
                "trauma_upper_ext": "The image shows a fenced-off area, with debris and what appears to be damaged structures visible in the background. The foreground is partially obscured by a wire mesh fence, through which the scene can be dimly observed. There is no person visible in the image, so I cannot comment on any potential arm injuries. The scene appears to depict some kind of damaged or abandoned outdoor area, but without any visible human subjects, I cannot provide any more specific details about the situation.",
                "alertness_ocular": "The image does not show any people. It depicts a wire mesh fence or cage surrounded by some debris and overgrown vegetation. There is a structure or building visible in the background through the wire mesh barrier. The scene appears to be of an outdoor, enclosed area with no people visible.",

There are branches and debris scattered in the foreground, but I do not see any indication of severe injuries or amputations. The scene appears to be a secluded outdoor location, but without further context, I cannot make any assumptions about what may have occurred there. I will refrain from speculating about potential injuries or violent events, and instead simply describe the visual elements I observe in the image.",
